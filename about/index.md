##Hi, I'm Nic.

That's me over there, with my son, Oscar.

I work from my garden studio at my home in leafy Hitchin, UK. I live with my wife, Juliet, and
my two children, Oscar and Emilie.

Why do you need to know this? Well, if we're going to work together then we need to get on. Think of
this bit as the smalltalk at a cocktail party.

I am a passionate believer that good design is the best way to solve a problem whether that is archetectural,
aesthetic or practical. I am an advocate for web standards and progressive enhancement. I like my websites to be
accessible to anyone. I will always try and use the latest technologies available but only if they are the most
suitable for the project. I try not to get swept along with trends and fads - good design is simple and timeless.

If you share my passion for good design and think we could work together please [get in touch](http://nicleb.com/contact).
