##A Little Bit About Me...

Working from a garden studio in lovely Hitchin about an hour from London, UK, I am a self-taught web developer and designer. I mostly work on my own development projects using a combination of the core web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) along with PHP (especially the Symfony 2 framework) and Sencha Touch for mobile apps.

I have recently decided to start taking on a small number of clients. If you require a new site, an overhaul of an existing site or anything else web related then please [get in touch](contact).

My time is currently split between web development and being a professional musician working in the theatres of London's West End. I find the combination of my two passions not only keeps me busy but each influences how I work with the other.

When I'm not working you will find me playing with my two children, reading books or watching property programs on TV.
