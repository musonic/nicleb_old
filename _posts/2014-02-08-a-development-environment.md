## Getting Started - a basic development environment

So, before we can do any exciting coding it's good to get yourself setup and feeling comfortable. It's a bit like cooking a new recipe and making sure you've got all of your ingredients out on the counter before you start rather than scrabbling around at the back of a cupboard once you're halfway through.

I will put a reference at the end of each article with relevant links. I will also try and use inline links where appropriate and if there are technical terms (or even semi-technical terms) I will try and link to Wikipedia articles.

In this post I'm going to guide you through how I setup my current development environment. Please remember that:
1. This is just how I do it - there are a million and one ways to do the same thing.
2. This is only a basic setup. All of the things I talk about can be taken much, much further if you have the time, inclination, mental capacity etc.
3. IMPORTANT - I develop on a Mac running OS X. If you use a different operating system then I cannot guarantee that what I am doing will work without some modification. I would like to think that the fundementals will be the same, but you might have to do some googling to help!

### Aims

By the end of this article we should have:
1. A working development environment to enable us to write and test code.
2. Understand the basics of a good workflow.

### What is a development environment?

An environment is a way of seperating different stages of building a web site or app or whatever. At it's most basic level you will have a developement environment and a production environment. The development environment is where you'll spend most of your time and is usually on your local computer. This is where you write your code and check that everything works before releasing it to the wild. The production environment is where your code is when your site is live. This usually involves hosting of some kind unless you're able to run your own servers. 

Really you can define any number of environments in any way that you like. It depends on what works best for your workflow. The most common additional environment is often called the Staging environment. This is like a half-way house between development and production and is usually used for rigorous testing before the code is finally pushed up to the production server.

I'm going to show you how to setup two environments: developement and staging. Production environments depend on how you want to host your work so I will leave that for a later post.
